## DuhMyIP
Duh My IP - A simple JS &amp; Bootstrap system designed to speak an IP address.

This was a fun project I threw together back in High School in order to play around with the Bootstrap CSS.

### Idea
The idea was to take a set of spoken digits from audio files and string them together in order to speak one's IP.

### Features
There are three audio recordings of each digit in order to keep things interesting. Three intros and outros are also called in the randomization function.
